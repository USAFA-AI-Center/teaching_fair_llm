    "**What advantages does the hierarchical multi-agent approach have?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about:\n",
    "- **Manager-Worker Pattern**: Clear delegation and coordination\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Each worker focuses on one task with dedicated tools\n",
    "- **Stateless Workers**: Workers don't maintain conversation history (more efficient)\n",
    "- **Automatic Orchestration**: `HierarchicalAgentRunner` manages the workflow\n",
    "- **Synthesis by Manager**: Manager combines results into coherent final answer\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to add more specialists to the team\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is this different from our earlier sequential approach?**\n",
    "- Sequential: We manually called each agent and passed results around\n",
    "- Hierarchical: Manager decides when and how to delegate automatically\n",
    "- Hierarchical: Manager synthesizes results intelligently based on observations"

    "\n",
    "### The Architecture:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Manager Agent (ManagerPlanner)\n",
    "    ├─→ Delegates to GrammarSpecialist\n",
    "    │   └─→ Returns grammar report\n",
    "    ├─→ Delegates to ContentSpecialist\n",
    "    │   └─→ Returns content report\n",
    "    └─→ Synthesizes final evaluation\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Final Answer to User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ManagerPlanner:**\n",
    "- Special planner that understands delegation\n",
    "- Has two \"tools\": `delegate` and `final_answer`\n",
    "- Decides which worker to use based on the task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worker Agents:**\n",
    "- Stateless (don't maintain conversation history)\n",
    "- Each has specific tools and expertise\n",
    "- Return results to manager via observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**HierarchicalAgentRunner:**\n",
    "- Orchestrates the entire workflow\n",
    "- Routes delegations to correct workers\n",
    "- Passes worker results back to manager as observations\n",
    "- Manages the coordination loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Pattern Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Separation**: Manager thinks strategically, workers execute tactically\n",
    "2. **Flexible Coordination**: Manager can adapt based on worker results\n",
    "3. **Production-Ready**: Same pattern used in complex enterprise systems\n",
    "4. **Explainable**: You can see the entire decision chain"
